## Sequential Domain and Instruction Fine-Tuning of Qwen3-1.7B for Mental Health Assistance

This repository demonstrates end-to-end parameter-efficient domain adaptation fine-tuning of the Qwen3-1.7B base LLM on a custom mental health PDF document, followed by instruction fine-tuning on mental health counseling conversations dataset. It showcases how a general-purpose LLM can be adapted to a sensitive, domain-specific task (mental health) using techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, without requiring large-scale compute or full model retraining.
